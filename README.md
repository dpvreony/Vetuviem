# Vetuviem
Vetuvium is a DSL to support View to View Model binding (MVVM -> V2VM -> Ve-Tu-Viem).

## Mission Statement
* To give a mechanism to reduce the amount of boiler plate code being produced, by allowing some of the ReactiveUI specific logic to be hidden away
* Allow the developer to think along the lines of standard behaviours for controls by offering a way to produce re-usable behaviours through a class and\or function design pattern
* Allow the developer to focus on what matters on the ViewModel
* Reduce the cognitive load by
  * Removing the risk of misusing 1 way or 2 way binding
  * Remove the need for the user to think about having to cater for Bind vs BindCommand
* Offer a structure that allows for more work to be done potentially with Source Generators to reduce reflection.
